CONTENTS Stave I Marley's Ghost Stave II The First of the Three Spirits Stave III The Second of the Three Spirits Stave IV The Last of the Spirits Stave V The End of It STAVE I MARLEY'S GHOST MARLEY was dead to begin with
There is no doubt whatever about that
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner
Scrooge signed it and Scrooge's name was good upon Change for anything he chose to put his hand to
Old Marley was as dead as a
Mind
I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about a
I might have been inclined myself to regard a as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade
But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the Country's done for
You will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that Marley was as dead as a
Scrooge knew he was dead
Of course he did
How could it be otherwise
Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years
Scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner
And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain
The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from
There is no doubt that Marley was dead
This must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate
If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's Father died before the play began there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night in an easterly wind upon his own ramparts than there would be in any other gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy Saint Paul's Churchyard for literally to astonish his son's weak mind
Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name
There it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door Scrooge and Marley
The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley
Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge and sometimes Marley but he answered to both names
It was all the same to him
Oh
But he was a hand at the Scrooge
a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner
Hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous secret and and solitary as an oyster
The cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his made his eyes red his thin lips and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice
A frosty rime was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin
He carried his own low temperature always about with he iced his office in the and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas
External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge
No warmth could warm no wintry weather chill him
No wind that blew was bitterer than he no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose no pelting rain less open to entreaty
Foul weather didn't know where to have him
The heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect
They often came down handsomely and Scrooge never did
Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks My dear Scrooge how are you
When will you come to see me
No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle no children asked him what it was o'clock no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place of Scrooge
Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know and when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into doorways and up and then would wag their tails as though they said No eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master
But what did Scrooge care
It was the very thing he liked
To edge his way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to Scrooge
Once upon a all the good days in the year on Christmas Scrooge sat busy in his
It was cold bleak biting weather foggy withal and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down beating their hands upon their breasts and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them
The city clocks had only just gone three but it was quite dark it had not been light all candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air
The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms
To see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought that Nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale
The door of Scrooge's was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying letters
Scrooge had a very small fire but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal
But he couldn't replenish it for Scrooge kept the in his own and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part
Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to warm himself at the in which effort not being a man of a strong imagination he failed
A merry Christmas uncle
God save you
cried a cheerful voice
It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach
Bah
said Scrooge Humbug
He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of Scrooge's that he was all in a his face was ruddy and his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again
Christmas a humbug uncle
said Scrooge's nephew
You don't mean that I am sure
I said Scrooge
Merry Christmas
What right have you to be merry
What reason have you to be merry
You're poor enough
Come returned the nephew gaily
What right have you to be dismal
What reason have you to be morose
You're rich enough
Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said Bah
and followed it up with Humbug
Don't be cross uncle
said the nephew
What else can I returned the uncle when I live in such a world of fools as this
Merry Christmas
Out upon merry Christmas
What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without a time for finding yourself a year older but not an hour a time for balancing your books and having every item in em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you
If I could work my said Scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart
He should
Uncle
pleaded the nephew
Nephew
returned the uncle sternly keep Christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine
Keep it
repeated Scrooge's nephew
But you don't keep it
Let me leave it alone said Scrooge
Much good may it do you
Much good it has ever done you
There are many things from which I might have derived good by which I have not profited I dare returned the nephew
Christmas among the rest
But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time when it has come from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from a good a kind forgiving charitable pleasant the only time I know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys
And therefore uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket I believe that it has done me good and will do me and I say God bless it
The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded
Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark for ever
Let me hear another sound from said Scrooge and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation
You're quite a powerful speaker he added turning to his nephew
I wonder you don't go into Parliament
Don't be angry uncle
Come
Dine with us
Scrooge said that he would see indeed he did
He went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity first
But why
cried Scrooge's nephew
Why
Why did you get married
said Scrooge
Because I fell in love
Because you fell in love
growled Scrooge as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas
Good afternoon
Nay uncle but you never came to see me before that happened
Why give it as a reason for not coming now
Good said Scrooge
I want nothing from I ask nothing of why cannot we be friends
Good said Scrooge
I am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute
We have never had any quarrel to which I have been a party
But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last
So A Merry Christmas uncle
Good afternoon
said Scrooge
And A Happy New Year
Good afternoon
said Scrooge
His nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding
He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than for he returned them cordially
There's another muttered who overheard him my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry Christmas
I'll retire to Bedlam
This lunatic in letting Scrooge's nephew out had let two other people in
They were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in Scrooge's office
They had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him
Scrooge and Marley's I said one of the gentlemen referring to his list
Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr
Scrooge or Mr
Marley
Mr
Marley has been dead these seven Scrooge replied
He died seven years ago this very night
We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving said the gentleman presenting his credentials
It certainly for they had been two kindred spirits
At the ominous word Scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back
At this festive season of the year Mr
said the gentleman taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time
Many thousands are in want of common hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir
Are there no prisons
asked Scrooge
Plenty of said the gentleman laying down the pen again
And the Union workhouses
demanded Scrooge
Are they still in operation
They are
returned the gentleman I wish I could say they were not
The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour then
said Scrooge
Both very busy sir
Oh
I was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful said Scrooge
I'm very glad to hear it
Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the returned the gentleman a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink and means of warmth
We choose this time because it is a time of all others when Want is keenly felt and Abundance rejoices
What shall I put you down for
Nothing
Scrooge replied
You wish to be anonymous
I wish to be left said Scrooge
Since you ask me what I wish gentlemen that is my answer
I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't afford to make idle people merry
I help to support the establishments I have cost and those who are badly off must go there
Many can't go and many would rather die
If they would rather said Scrooge they had better do it and decrease the surplus population
don't know that
But you might know observed the gentleman
It's not my Scrooge returned
It's enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other people's
Mine occupies me constantly
Good afternoon gentlemen
Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew
Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him
Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with flaring links proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way
The ancient tower of a church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there
The cold became intense
In the main street at the corner of the court some labourers were repairing the and had lighted a great fire in a brazier round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture
The being left in solitude its overflowings sullenly congealed and turned to misanthropic ice
The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows made pale faces ruddy as they passed
Poulterers and grocers trades became a splendid joke a glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do
The Lord Mayor in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household and even the little tailor whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets stirred up pudding in his garret while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef
Foggier yet and colder
Piercing searching biting cold
If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather as that instead of using his familiar weapons then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose
The owner of one scant young nose gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol but at the first sound of God bless you merry gentleman
May nothing you dismay
Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost
At length the hour of shutting up the arrived
With an Scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat
You'll want all day I suppose
said Scrooge
If quite convenient sir
It's not said Scrooge and it's not fair
If I was to stop for it you'd think yourself I'll be bound
The clerk smiled faintly
And said Scrooge you don't think me when I pay a day's wages for no work
The clerk observed that it was only once a year
A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every of December
said Scrooge buttoning his to the chin
But I suppose you must have the whole day
Be here all the earlier next morning
The clerk promised that he and Scrooge walked out with a growl
The office was closed in a twinkling and the clerk with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist for he boasted no went down a slide on Cornhill at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being Christmas Eve and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt to play at
Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his went home to bed
He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner
They were a gloomy suite of rooms in a lowering pile of building up a yard where it had so little business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house playing at with other houses and forgotten the way out again
It was old enough now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but Scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices
The yard was so dark that even Scrooge who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands
The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold
Now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it was very large
It is also a fact that Scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence in that also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London even is a bold corporation aldermen and livery
Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon
And then let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that Scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of a knocker but Marley's face
Marley's face
It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar
It was not angry or ferocious but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead
The hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless
That and its livid colour made it but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control rather than a part of its own expression
As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again
To say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue
But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle
He did pause with a moment's irresolution before he shut the and he did look cautiously behind it first as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall
But there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he said Pooh pooh
and closed it with a bang
The sound resounded through the house like thunder
Every room above and every cask in the cellars below appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own
Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes
He fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the slowly too trimming his candle as he went
You may talk vaguely about driving a up a good old flight of stairs or through a bad young Act of but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase and taken it broadwise with the towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades and done it easy
There was plenty of width for that and room to which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom
out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip
Up Scrooge went not caring a button for that
Darkness is cheap and Scrooge liked it
But before he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms to see that all was right
He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that
bedroom
All as they should be
Nobody under the table nobody under the a small fire in the spoon and basin and the little saucepan of gruel Scrooge had a cold in his head upon the hob
Nobody under the nobody in the nobody in his which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall
as usual
Old old shoes two on three legs and a poker
Quite satisfied he closed his door and locked himself himself in which was not his custom
Thus secured against surprise he took off his put on his and slippers and his and sat down before the fire to take his gruel
It was a very low fire nothing on such a bitter night
He was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel
The fireplace was an old one built by some Dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles designed to illustrate the Scriptures
There were Cains and Abels Pharaoh's Queens of Sheba Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like Abrahams Belshazzars Apostles putting off to sea in hundreds of figures to attract his and yet that face of Marley seven years dead came like the ancient Prophet's rod and swallowed up the whole
If each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one
Humbug
said and walked across the room
After several turns he sat down again
As he threw his head back in the chair his glance happened to rest upon a bell a disused bell that hung in the room and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building
It was with great astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he looked he saw this bell begin to swing
It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a but soon it rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house
This might have lasted half a minute or a minute but it seemed an hour
The bells ceased as they had begun together
They were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the cellar
Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains
The flew open with a booming sound and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors then coming up the then coming straight towards his door
It's humbug still
said Scrooge
I won't believe it
His colour changed though when without a pause it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes
Upon its coming in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried I know Marley's Ghost
and fell again
The same face the very same
Marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his and the hair upon his head
The chain he drew was clasped about his middle
It was long and wound about him like a and it was made for Scrooge observed it closely of keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel
His body was so that Scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind
Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels but he had never believed it until now
No nor did he believe it even now
Though he looked the phantom through and through and saw it standing before though he felt the chilling influence of its and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin which wrapper he had not observed he was still incredulous and fought against his senses
How now
said Scrooge caustic and cold as ever
What do you want with me
Much
voice no doubt about it
Who are you
Ask me who I was
Who were you then
said Scrooge raising his voice
You're particular for a shade
He was going to say to a but substituted this as more appropriate
In life I was your partner Jacob Marley
Can you sit down
asked Scrooge looking doubtfully at him
I can
Do it then
Scrooge asked the question because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a and felt that in the event of its being impossible it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation
But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he were quite used to it
You don't believe in observed the Ghost
I said Scrooge
What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses
I don't said Scrooge
Why do you doubt your senses
said Scrooge a little thing affects them
A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats
You may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato
There's more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are
Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then
The truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones
To sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play Scrooge felt the very deuce with him
There was something very awful too in the spectre's being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own
Scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven
You see this toothpick
said Scrooge returning quickly to the charge for the reason just and wishing though it were only for a second to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself
I replied the Ghost
You are not looking at said Scrooge
But I see said the Ghost notwithstanding
Well
returned Scrooge I have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own creation
Humbug I tell you
humbug
At this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that Scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon
But how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head as if it were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast
Scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face
Mercy
he said
Dreadful apparition why do you trouble me
Man of the worldly mind
replied the Ghost do you believe in me or not
I said Scrooge
I must
But why do spirits walk the earth and why do they come to me
It is required of every the Ghost returned that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen and travel far and and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death
It is doomed to wander through the woe is me
witness what it cannot share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness
Again the spectre raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands
You are said Scrooge trembling
Tell me why
I wear the chain I forged in replied the Ghost
I made it link by link and yard by I girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will I wore it
Is its pattern strange to you
Scrooge trembled more and more
Or would you pursued the Ghost the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself
It was full as heavy and as long as this seven Christmas Eves ago
You have laboured on it since
It is a ponderous chain
Scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing
he said imploringly
Old Jacob Marley tell me more
Speak comfort to me Jacob
I have none to the Ghost replied
It comes from other regions Ebenezer Scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men
Nor can I tell you what I would
A very little more is all permitted to me
I cannot rest I cannot stay I cannot linger anywhere
My spirit never walked beyond our me
life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our and weary journeys lie before me
It was a habit with Scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets
Pondering on what the Ghost had said he did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees
You must have been very slow about it Scrooge observed in a manner though with humility and deference
Slow
the Ghost repeated
Seven years mused Scrooge
And travelling all the time
The whole said the Ghost
No rest no peace
Incessant torture of remorse
You travel fast
said Scrooge
On the wings of the replied the Ghost
You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven said Scrooge
The Ghost on hearing this set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance
Oh
captive bound and cried the phantom not to know that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed
Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness
Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused
Yet such was I
Oh
such was I
But you were always a good man of business faltered Scrooge who now began to apply this to himself
Business
cried the Ghost wringing its hands again
Mankind was my business
The common welfare was my charity mercy forbearance and benevolence were all my business
The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business
It held up its chain at arm's length as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief and flung it heavily upon the ground again
At this time of the rolling the spectre said I suffer most
Why did I walk through crowds of with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode
Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me
Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate and began to quake exceedingly
Hear me
cried the Ghost
My time is nearly gone
I said Scrooge
But don't be hard upon me
Don't be flowery Jacob
Pray
How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see I may not tell
I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day
It was not an agreeable idea
Scrooge shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow
That is no light part of my pursued the Ghost
I am here to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate
A chance and hope of my procuring Ebenezer
You were always a good friend to said Scrooge
Thank'ee
You will be resumed the Ghost by Three Spirits
Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done
Is that the chance and hope you mentioned Jacob
he demanded in a faltering voice
It is
think I'd rather said Scrooge
Without their said the Ghost you cannot hope to shun the path I tread
Expect the first when the bell tolls One
Couldn't I take em all at once and have it over Jacob
hinted Scrooge
Expect the second on the next night at the same hour
The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate
Look to see me no and look that for your own sake you remember what has passed between us
When it had said these words the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head as before
Scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage
He ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and about its arm
The apparition walked backward from and at every step it took the window raised itself a little so that when the spectre reached it it was wide open
It beckoned Scrooge to approach which he did
When they were within two paces of each other Marley's Ghost held up its hand warning him to come no nearer
Scrooge stopped
Not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear for on the raising of the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the incoherent sounds of lamentation and wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and
The spectre after listening for a moment joined in the mournful and floated out upon the bleak dark night
Scrooge followed to the window desperate in his curiosity
He looked out
The air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went
Every one of them wore chains like Marley's some few they might be guilty governments were linked none were free
Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives
He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant whom it saw below upon a
The misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and had lost the power for ever
Whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them he could not tell
But they and their spirit voices faded and the night became as it had been when he walked home
Scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered
It was as he had locked it with his own hands and the bolts were undisturbed
He tried to say Humbug
but stopped at the first syllable
And being from the emotion he had undergone or the fatigues of the day or his glimpse of the Invisible World or the dull conversation of the Ghost or the lateness of the hour much in need of went straight to bed without undressing and fell asleep upon the instant
STAVE II THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS WHEN Scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber
He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters
So he listened for the hour
To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to then stopped
Twelve
It was past two when he went to bed
The clock was wrong
An icicle must have got into the works
Twelve
He touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock
Its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped
Why it isn't said Scrooge that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night
It isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon
The idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window
He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his before he could see and could see very little then
All he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold and that there was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world
This was a great relief because three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr
Ebenezer Scrooge or his and so forth would have become a mere United States security if there were no days to count by
Scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and over and could make nothing of it
The more he thought the more perplexed he and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he thought
Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly
Every time he resolved within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position and presented the same problem to be worked all through Was it a dream or not
Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more when he remembered on a sudden that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one
He resolved to lie awake until the hour was and considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power
The quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock
At length it broke upon his listening ear
Ding dong
A quarter said Scrooge counting
Ding dong
said Scrooge
Ding dong
A quarter to said Scrooge
Ding dong
The hour said Scrooge triumphantly and nothing else
He spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a deep dull hollow melancholy ONE
Light flashed up in the room upon the instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn
The curtains of his bed were drawn aside I tell you by a hand
Not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to which his face was addressed
The curtains of his bed were drawn and Scrooge starting up into a attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as I am now to you and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow
It was a strange a child yet not so like a child as like an old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to a child's proportions
Its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white as if with and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin
The arms were very long and the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength
Its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare
It wore a tunic of the purest and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful
It held a branch of fresh green holly in its and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers
But the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light by which all this was and which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm
Even this though when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was not its strangest quality
For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another and what was light one instant at another time was dark so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness being now a thing with one arm now with one leg now with twenty legs now a pair of legs without a head now a head without a body of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away
And in the very wonder of this it would be itself distinct and clear as ever
Are you the Spirit sir whose coming was foretold to me
asked Scrooge
I am
The voice was soft and gentle
Singularly low as if instead of being so close beside him it were at a distance
Who and what are you
Scrooge demanded
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past
Long Past
inquired Scrooge observant of its dwarfish stature
No
Your past
Perhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have asked but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his and begged him to be covered
What
exclaimed the Ghost would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light I give
Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow
Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the Spirit at any period of his life
He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there
Your welfare
said the Ghost
Scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end
The Spirit must have heard him thinking for it said immediately Your reclamation then
Take heed
It put out its strong hand as it spoke and clasped him gently by the arm
Rise
and walk with me
It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below that he was clad but lightly in his slippers and and that he had a cold upon him at that time
The grasp though gentle as a woman's hand was not to be resisted
He rose but finding that the Spirit made towards the window clasped his robe in supplication
I am a Scrooge remonstrated and liable to fall
Bear but a touch of my hand said the Spirit laying it upon his heart and you shall be upheld in more than this
As the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand
The city had entirely vanished
Not a vestige of it was to be seen
The darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground
Good Heaven
said Scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him
I was bred in this place
I was a boy here
The Spirit gazed upon him mildly
Its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old man's sense of feeling
He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten
Your lip is said the Ghost
And what is that upon your cheek
Scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would
You recollect the way
inquired the Spirit
Remember it
cried Scrooge with I could walk it blindfold
Strange to have forgotten it for so many years
observed the Ghost
Let us go on
They walked along the road Scrooge recognising every gate and post and until a little appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river
Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers
All these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it
These are but shadows of the things that have said the Ghost
They have no consciousness of us
The jocund travellers came and as they came Scrooge knew and named them every one
Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them
Why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past
Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas as they parted at and for their several homes
What was merry Christmas to Scrooge
Out upon merry Christmas
What good had it ever done to him
The school is not quite said the Ghost
A solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still
Scrooge said he knew it
And he sobbed
They left the by a lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it
It was a large house but one of broken for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed
Fowls clucked and strutted in the and the and sheds were with grass
Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast
There was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by and not too much to eat
They went the Ghost and Scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house
It opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks
At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble and Scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be
Not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears
The Spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading
Suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood
Why it's Ali Baba
Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy
It's dear old honest Ali Baba
Yes yes I know
One Christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that
Poor boy
And said Scrooge and his wild brother there they go
And what's his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the Gate of don't you see him
And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the there he is upon his head
Serve him right
I'm glad of it
What business had he to be married to the Princess
To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and and to see his heightened and excited would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed
There's the Parrot
cried Scrooge
Green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his there he is
Poor Robin Crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island
Poor Robin Crusoe where have you been Robin Crusoe
The man thought he was dreaming but he wasn't
It was the Parrot you know
There goes Friday running for his life to the little creek
Halloa
Hoop
Halloo
Then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self Poor boy
and cried again
I Scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff but it's too late now
What is the matter
asked the Spirit
said Scrooge
Nothing
There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night
I should like to have given him something that's all
The Ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand saying as it did so Let us see another Christmas
Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words and the room became a little darker and more dirty
The panels shrunk the windows fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were shown but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more than you do
He only knew that it was quite that everything had happened that there he was alone again when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays
He was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly
Scrooge looked at the Ghost and with a mournful shaking of his head glanced anxiously towards the door
It and a little girl much younger than the boy came darting in and putting her arms about his neck and often kissing him addressed him as her Dear dear brother
I have come to bring you home dear brother
said the child clapping her tiny hands and bending down to laugh
To bring you home home home
Home little Fan
returned the boy
Yes
said the child brimful of glee
Home for good and all
Home for ever and ever
Father is so much kinder than he used to be that home's like Heaven
He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come and he said Yes you and sent me in a coach to bring you
And you're to be a man
said the child opening her eyes and are never to come back but first we're to be together all the Christmas long and have the merriest time in all the world
You are quite a woman little Fan
exclaimed the boy
She clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his but being too little laughed again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him
Then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the and he nothing loth to go accompanied her
A terrible voice in the hall cried Bring down Master Scrooge's box there
and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him
He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering that ever was seen where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold
Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine and a block of curiously heavy cake and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people at the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of something to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before he had rather not
Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise the children bade the schoolmaster right and getting into it drove gaily down the the quick wheels dashing the and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray
Always a delicate creature whom a breath might have said the Ghost
But she had a large heart
So she cried Scrooge
You're right
I will not gainsay it Spirit
God forbid
She died a said the Ghost and had as I think children
One Scrooge returned
said the Ghost
Your nephew
Scrooge seemed uneasy in his and answered briefly Yes
Although they had but that moment left the school behind them they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city where shadowy passengers passed and where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way and all the strife and tumult of a real city were
It was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was Christmas time but it was evening and the streets were lighted up
The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked Scrooge if he knew it
Know it
said Scrooge
Was I apprenticed here
They went in
At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling Scrooge cried in great excitement Why it's old Fezziwig
Bless his it's Fezziwig alive again
Old Fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven
He rubbed his adjusted his capacious laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice Yo ho there
Ebenezer
Dick
Scrooge's former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his
Dick Wilkins to be sure
said Scrooge to the Ghost
Bless me yes
There he is
He was very much attached to me was Dick
Poor Dick
Dear dear
Yo ho my boys
said Fezziwig
No more work
Christmas Eve Dick
Christmas Ebenezer
Let's have the shutters cried old Fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands before a man can say Jack Robinson
You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it
They charged into the street with the two em up in their five em and pinned eight came back before you could have got to twelve panting like
cried old Fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility
Clear away my lads and let's have lots of room here
Dick
Chirrup Ebenezer
Clear away
There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away or couldn't have cleared away with old Fezziwig looking on
It was done in a minute
Every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from public life for the floor was swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a as you would desire to see upon a winter's night
In came a fiddler with a and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty
In came Mrs
Fezziwig one vast substantial smile
In came the three Miss Fezziwigs beaming and lovable
In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke
In came all the young men and women employed in the business
In came the housemaid with her cousin the baker
In came the cook with her brother's particular friend the milkman
In came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress
In they all came one after some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some in they all came anyhow and everyhow
Away they all went twenty couple at hands half round and back again the other down the middle and up round and round in various stages of affectionate old top couple always turning up in the wrong new top couple starting off again as soon as they got all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them
When this result was brought about old Fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out Well done
and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose
But scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish
There were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of Cold Roast and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled and there were and plenty of beer
But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled when the fiddler an artful dog mind
The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him
struck up Sir Roger de Coverley
Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs
Fezziwig
Top couple with a good stiff piece of work cut out for three or four and twenty pair of people who were not to be trifled people who would dance and had no notion of walking
But if they had been twice as four Fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would Mrs
Fezziwig
As to her she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term
If that's not high praise tell me higher and I'll use it
A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves
They shone in every part of the dance like moons
You couldn't have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next
And when old Fezziwig and Mrs
Fezziwig had gone all through the advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and curtsey corkscrew and back again to your Fezziwig so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger
When the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up
Mr
and Mrs
Fezziwig took their stations one on either side of the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a Merry Christmas
When everybody had retired but the two prentices they did the same to and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their which were under a counter in the
During the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits
His heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self
He corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation
It was not until now when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them that he remembered the Ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear
A small said the Ghost to make these silly folks so full of gratitude
Small
echoed Scrooge
The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig and when he had done so said Why
Is it not
He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money three or four perhaps
Is that so much that he deserves this praise
It isn't said Scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self
It isn't that Spirit
He has the power to render us happy or to make our service light or a pleasure or a toil
Say that his power lies in words and in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count em up what then
The happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune
He felt the Spirit's glance and stopped
What is the matter
asked the Ghost
Nothing said Scrooge
Something I think
the Ghost insisted
said Scrooge No
I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now
That's all
His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air
My time grows observed the Spirit
Quick
This was not addressed to Scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produced an immediate effect
For again Scrooge saw himself
He was older a man in the prime of life
His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice
There was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall
He was not alone but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past
It matters she said softly
To you very little
Another idol has displaced and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come as I would have tried to do I have no just cause to grieve
What Idol has displaced you
he rejoined
A golden one
This is the dealing of the world
he said
There is nothing on which it is so hard as and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth
You fear the world too she answered gently
All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach
I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one until the Gain engrosses you
Have I not
What then
he retorted
Even if I have grown so much wiser what then
I am not changed towards you
She shook her head
Am I
Our contract is an old one
It was made when we were both poor and content to be so until in good season we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry
You are changed
When it was made you were another man
I was a he said impatiently
Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you she returned
I am
That which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two
How often and how keenly I have thought of this I will not say
It is enough that I have thought of it and can release you
Have I ever sought release
In words
No
Never
In what then
In a changed in an altered in another atmosphere of another Hope as its great end
In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight
If this had never been between said the girl looking mildly but with steadiness upon tell me would you seek me out and try to win me now
Ah no
He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of himself
But he said with a struggle You think not
I would gladly think otherwise if I she answered Heaven knows
When I have learned a Truth like this I know how strong and irresistible it must be
But if you were free yesterday can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by Gain or choosing her if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow
I and I release you
With a full heart for the love of him you once were
He was about to but with her head turned from him she resumed
You memory of what is past half makes me hope you pain in this
A very very brief time and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you awoke
May you be happy in the life you have chosen
She left him and they parted
Spirit
said Scrooge show me no more
Conduct me home
Why do you delight to torture me
One shadow more
exclaimed the Ghost
No more
cried Scrooge
No more
I don't wish to see it
Show me no more
But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened next
They were in another scene and a room not very large or handsome but full of comfort
Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter
The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty
The consequences were uproarious beyond but no one seemed to on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very and the latter soon beginning to mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly
What would I not have given to be one of them
Though I never could have been so rude no no
I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it and for the precious little shoe I wouldn't have plucked it off God bless my soul
to save my life
As to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold young brood I couldn't have done I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again
And yet I should have dearly liked I own to have touched her to have questioned her that she might have opened to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a to have let loose waves of hair an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price in short I should have liked I do confess to have had the lightest licence of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its value
But now a knocking at the door was heard and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group just in time to greet the father who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents
Then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter
The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets despoil him of parcels hold on tight by his cravat hug him round his neck pommel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible affection
The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received
The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's into his mouth and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter
The immense relief of finding this a false alarm
The joy and gratitude and ecstasy
They are all indescribable alike
It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour and by one stair at a time up to the top of the where they went to bed and so subsided
And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own and when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have called him father and been a in the haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed
said the husband turning to his wife with a smile I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon
Who was it
Guess
How can I
Tut don't I know
she added in the same breath laughing as he laughed
Mr
Scrooge
Mr
Scrooge it was
I passed his office and as it was not shut up and he had a candle inside I could scarcely help seeing him
His partner lies upon the point of death I and there he sat alone
Quite alone in the world I do believe
Spirit
said Scrooge in a broken voice remove me from this place
I told you these were shadows of the things that have said the Ghost
That they are what they are do not blame me
Remove me
Scrooge exclaimed I cannot bear it
He turned upon the Ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it
Leave me
Take me back
Haunt me no longer
In the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and and dimly connecting that with its influence over him he seized the and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head
The Spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground
He was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible and further of being in his own bedroom
He gave the cap a parting squeeze in which his hand and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep
STAVE III THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One
He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley's intervention
But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back he put them every one aside with his own and lying down again established a sharp all round the bed
For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous
Gentlemen of the sort who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two and being usually equal to the express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from to between which opposite extremes no doubt there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects
Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much
Now being prepared for almost anything he was not by any means prepared for and consequently when the Bell struck One and no shape appeared he was taken with a violent fit of trembling
Five minutes ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came
All this time he lay upon his bed the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the and which being only light was more alarming than a dozen ghosts as he was powerless to make out what it meant or would be and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion without having the consolation of knowing it
At last however he began to you or I would have thought at for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it and would unquestionably have done it last I say he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room from whence on further tracing it it seemed to shine
This idea taking full possession of his mind he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door
The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by his name and bade him enter
He obeyed
It was his own room
There was no doubt about that
But it had undergone a surprising transformation
The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green that it looked a perfect from every part of which bright gleaming berries glistened
The crisp leaves of holly mistletoe and ivy reflected back the light as if so many little mirrors had been scattered and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time or Marley's or for many and many a winter season gone
Heaped up on the floor to form a kind of throne were turkeys geese game poultry brawn great joints of meat long wreaths of sausages barrels of oysters chestnuts apples juicy oranges luscious pears immense and seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam
In easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly Giant glorious to who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike Plenty's horn and held it up high up to shed its light on Scrooge as he came peeping round the door
Come in
exclaimed the Ghost
Come in
and know me better man
Scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this Spirit
He was not the dogged Scrooge he had and though the Spirit's eyes were clear and kind he did not like to meet them
I am the Ghost of Christmas said the Spirit
Look upon me
Scrooge reverently did so
It was clothed in one simple green robe or mantle bordered with white fur
This garment hung so loosely on the figure that its capacious breast was bare as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice
Its feet observable beneath the ample folds of the garment were also and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath set here and there with shining icicles
Its dark brown curls were long and free as its genial face its sparkling eye its open hand its cheery voice its unconstrained demeanour and its joyful air
Girded round its middle was an antique but no sword was in it and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust
You have never seen the like of me before
exclaimed the Spirit
Scrooge made answer to it
Have never walked forth with the younger members of my meaning for I am very young my elder brothers born in these later years
pursued the Phantom
I don't think I said Scrooge
I am afraid I have not
Have you had many brothers Spirit
More than eighteen said the Ghost
A tremendous family to provide for
muttered Scrooge
The Ghost of Christmas Present rose
said Scrooge submissively conduct me where you will
I went forth last night on compulsion and I learnt a lesson which is working now
if you have aught to teach me let me profit by it
Touch my robe
Scrooge did as he was told and held it fast
Holly mistletoe red berries ivy turkeys geese game poultry brawn meat pigs sausages oysters pies puddings fruit and punch all vanished instantly
So did the room the fire the ruddy glow the hour of night and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning where for the weather was severe the people made a rough but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings and from the tops of their houses whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below and splitting into artificial little
The house fronts looked black enough and the windows blacker contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs and with the dirtier snow upon the which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and furrows that crossed and each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched and made intricate channels hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water
The sky was gloomy and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist half thawed half frozen whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had by one consent caught fire and were blazing away to their dear hearts content
There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain
For the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of calling out to one another from the parapets and now and then exchanging a facetious missile far than many a wordy laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong
The poulterers shops were still half open and the fruiterers were radiant in their glory
There were great round baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence
There were ruddy Spanish Onions shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the mistletoe
There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming there were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeepers benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might water gratis as they there were piles of filberts mossy and brown recalling in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered there were Norfolk Biffins squat and swarthy setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons and in the great compactness of their juicy persons urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner
The very gold and silver fish set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl though members of a dull and race appeared to know that there was something going and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement
The Grocers
oh the Grocers
nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or but through those gaps such glimpses
It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so extremely white the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the other spices so delicious the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest feel faint and subsequently bilious
Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their boxes or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door crashing their wicker baskets wildly and left their purchases upon the counter and came running back to fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humour while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose
But soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and away they came flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces
And at the same time there emerged from scores of lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers shops
The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway and taking off the covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch
And it was a very uncommon kind of torch for once or twice when there were angry words between some who had jostled each other he shed a few drops of water on them from it and their good humour was restored directly
For they said it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day
And so it was
God love it so it was
In time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker's where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too
Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch
asked Scrooge
There is
My own
Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day
asked Scrooge
To any kindly given
To a poor one most
Why to a poor one most
asked Scrooge
Because it needs it most
said Scrooge after a moment's thought I wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment
I
cried the Spirit
You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at said Scrooge
Wouldn't you
I
cried the Spirit
You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day
said Scrooge
And it comes to the same thing
I seek
exclaimed the Spirit
Forgive me if I am wrong
It has been done in your name or at least in that of your said Scrooge
There are some upon this earth of returned the Spirit who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion pride hatred envy bigotry and selfishness in our name who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived
Remember that and charge their doings on themselves not us
Scrooge promised that he and they went on invisible as they had been before into the suburbs of the town
It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost which Scrooge had observed at the that notwithstanding his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any place with and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall
And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his or else it was his own kind generous hearty nature and his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to Scrooge's for there he went and took Scrooge with him holding to his and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch
Think of that
Bob had but fifteen Bob he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his house
Then up rose Mrs
Cratchit Cratchit's wife dressed out but poorly in a gown but brave in ribbons which are cheap and make a goodly show for and she laid the cloth assisted by Belinda Cratchit second of her daughters also brave in while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar Bob's private property conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day into his mouth rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks
And now two smaller Cratchits boy and girl came tearing in screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the goose and known it for their and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion these young Cratchits danced about the table and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies while he not proud although his collars nearly choked him blew the fire until the slow potatoes bubbling up knocked loudly at the to be let out and peeled
What has ever got your precious father then
said Mrs
Cratchit
And your brother Tiny Tim
And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by
Here's Martha mother
said a girl appearing as she spoke
Here's Martha mother
cried the two young Cratchits
Hurrah
There's such a goose Martha
Why bless your heart alive my dear how late you are
said Mrs
Cratchit kissing her a dozen times and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal
We'd a deal of work to finish up last replied the girl and had to clear away this morning mother
Well
Never mind so long as you are said Mrs
Cratchit
Sit ye down before the fire my dear and have a warm Lord bless ye
No no
There's father cried the two young Cratchits who were everywhere at once
Hide Martha hide
So Martha hid herself and in came little Bob the father with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder
Alas for Tiny Tim he bore a little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame
Why where's our Martha
cried Bob Cratchit looking round
Not said Mrs
Cratchit
Not coming
said Bob with a sudden declension in his high for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way from church and had come home rampant
Not coming upon Christmas Day
Martha didn't like to see him disappointed if it were only in so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door and ran into his arms while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim and bore him off into the that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper
And how did little Tim behave
asked Mrs
Cratchit when she had rallied Bob on his credulity and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart's content
As good as said Bob and better
Somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever heard
He told me coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the church because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see
Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty
His active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the and while Bob turning up his if poor fellow they were capable of being made more some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to Master Peter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession
Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all a feathered phenomenon to which a black swan was a matter of in truth it was something very like it in that house
Mrs
Cratchit made the gravy ready beforehand in a little saucepan hissing Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible Miss Belinda sweetened up the Martha dusted the hot Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody not forgetting themselves and mounting guard upon their posts crammed spoons into their mouths lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped
At last the dishes were set on and grace was said
It was succeeded by a breathless pause as Mrs
Cratchit looking slowly all along the prepared to plunge it in the but when she did and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth one murmur of delight arose all round the board and even Tiny Tim excited by the two young Cratchits beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried Hurrah
There never was such a goose
Bob said he didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked
Its tenderness and flavour size and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration
Eked out by and mashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole indeed as Mrs
Cratchit said with great delight surveying one small atom of a bone upon the they hadn't ate it all at last
Yet every one had had enough and the youngest Cratchits in particular were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows
But now the plates being changed by Miss Belinda Mrs
Cratchit left the room nervous to bear take the pudding up and bring it in
Suppose it should not be done enough
Suppose it should break in turning out
Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the and stolen it while they were merry with the supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid
All sorts of horrors were supposed
Hallo
A great deal of steam
The pudding was out of the copper
A smell like a
That was the cloth
A smell like an and a pastrycook's next door to each other with a laundress's next door to that
That was the pudding
In half a minute Mrs
Cratchit but smiling the pudding like a speckled so hard and firm blazing in half of of ignited brandy and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top
Oh a wonderful pudding
Bob Cratchit said and calmly too that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs
Cratchit since their marriage
Mrs
Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour
Everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family
It would have been flat heresy to do so
Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing
At last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the hearth swept and the fire made up
The compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect apples and oranges were put upon the table and a of chestnuts on the fire
Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle meaning half a and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass
Two tumblers and a without a handle
These held the hot stuff from the jug however as well as golden goblets would have and Bob served it out with beaming looks while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily
Then Bob proposed A Merry Christmas to us all my dears
God bless us
Which all the family
God bless us every one
said Tiny Tim the last of all
He sat very close to his father's side upon his little stool
Bob held his withered little hand in his as if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him
said Scrooge with an interest he had never felt before tell me if Tiny Tim will live
I see a vacant replied the Ghost in the poor and a crutch without an owner carefully preserved
If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future the child will die
No said Scrooge
Oh no kind Spirit
say he will be spared
If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my returned the Ghost will find him here
What then
If he be like to die he had better do it and decrease the surplus population
Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit and was overcome with penitence and grief
said the Ghost if man you be in heart not adamant forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is and Where it is
Will you decide what men shall live what men shall die
It may be that in the sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child
Oh God
to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust
Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground
But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name
Mr
Scrooge
said I'll give you Mr
Scrooge the Founder of the Feast
The Founder of the Feast indeed
cried Mrs
Cratchit reddening
I wish I had him here
I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and I hope he'd have a good appetite for it
My said Bob the children
Christmas Day
It should be Christmas Day I am said she on which one drinks the health of such an odious stingy hard unfeeling man as Mr
Scrooge
You know he is Robert
Nobody knows it better than you do poor fellow
My was Bob's mild answer Christmas Day
I'll drink his health for your sake and the said Mrs
Cratchit not for his
Long life to him
A merry Christmas and a happy new year
He'll be very merry and very happy I have no doubt
The children drank the toast after her
It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness
Tiny Tim drank it last of all but he didn't care twopence for it
Scrooge was the Ogre of the family
The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party which was not dispelled for full five minutes
After it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with
Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter which would bring in if obtained full weekly
The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income
Martha who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's then told them what kind of work she had to do and how many hours she worked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed morning for a good long being a holiday she passed at home
Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before and how the lord was much about as tall as at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there
All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and and they had a song about a lost child travelling in the snow from Tiny Tim who had a plaintive little voice and sang it very well indeed
There was nothing of high mark in this
They were not a handsome they were not well their shoes were far from being their clothes were and Peter might have known and very likely did the inside of a pawnbroker's
But they were happy grateful pleased with one another and contented with the and when they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's torch at parting Scrooge had his eye upon them and especially on Tiny Tim until the last
By this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens parlours and all sorts of rooms was wonderful
Here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness
There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the first to greet them
Here again were shadows on the of guests and there a group of handsome girls all hooded and and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near neighbour's where woe upon the single man who saw them witches well they knew a glow
But if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires high
Blessings on it how the Ghost exulted
How it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach
The very lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas
And now without a word of warning from the Ghost they stood upon a bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about as though it were the of and water spread itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but for the frost that held it and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass
Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night
What place is this
asked Scrooge
A place where Miners live who labour in the bowels of the returned the Spirit
But they know me
See
A light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced towards it
Passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire
An old old man and woman with their children and their children's children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire
The old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them a Christmas had been a very old song when he was a from time to time they all joined in the chorus
So surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank again
The Spirit did not tarry here but bade Scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor
Not to sea
To sea
To Scrooge's horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth
Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse
Great heaps of clung to its base and of the wind one might suppose as of the and fell about it like the waves they skimmed
But even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea
Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of and one of them the elder too with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather as the of an old ship might be struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself
Again the Ghost sped on above the black and heaving sea being far away as he told Scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship
They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the in the bow the officers who had the dark ghostly figures in their several but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune or had a Christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day with homeward hopes belonging to it
And every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the and had shared to some extent in its and had remembered those he cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted to remember him
It was a great surprise to Scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as Death it was a great surprise to Scrooge while thus engaged to hear a hearty laugh
It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the Spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability
Ha ha
laughed Scrooge's nephew
Ha ha ha
If you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew all I can say is I should like to know him too
Introduce him to me and I'll cultivate his acquaintance
It is a fair noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and
When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions Scrooge's niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he
And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily
Ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
He said that Christmas was a humbug as I live
cried Scrooge's nephew
He believed it too
More shame for him Fred
said Scrooge's niece indignantly
Bless those they never do anything by halves
They are always in earnest
She was very pretty exceedingly pretty
With a dimpled capital a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be no doubt it all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head
Altogether she was what you would have called provoking you but satisfactory too
Oh perfectly satisfactory
He's a comical old said Scrooge's nephew that's the truth and not so pleasant as he might be
However his offences carry their own punishment and I have nothing to say against him
I'm sure he is very rich hinted Scrooge's niece
At least you always tell me so
What of that my dear
said Scrooge's nephew
His wealth is of no use to him
He don't do any good with it
He don't make himself comfortable with it
He hasn't the satisfaction of ha ha
he is ever going to benefit US with it
I have no patience with observed Scrooge's niece
Scrooge's niece's sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion
Oh I have
said Scrooge's nephew
I am sorry for I couldn't be angry with him if I tried
Who suffers by his ill whims
Himself always
Here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he won't come and dine with us
What's the consequence
He don't lose much of a dinner
Indeed I think he loses a very good interrupted Scrooge's niece
Everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight
Well
I'm very glad to hear said Scrooge's nephew because I haven't great faith in these young housekeepers
What do you say Topper
Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject
Whereat Scrooge's niece's plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the
Do go on said Scrooge's niece clapping her hands
He never finishes what he begins to say
He is such a ridiculous fellow
Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic his example was unanimously followed
I was only going to said Scrooge's nephew that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as I think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm
I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers
I mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for I pity him
He may rail at Christmas till he dies but he can't help thinking better of defy he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying Uncle Scrooge how are you
If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds that's and I think I shook him yesterday
It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge
But being thoroughly and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously
After tea they had some music
For they were a musical family and knew what they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch I can assure you especially Topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over it
Scrooge's niece played well upon the and played among other tunes a simple little air a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past
When this strain of music sounded all the things that Ghost had shown him came upon his he softened more and and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob Marley
But they didn't devote the whole evening to music
After a while they played at for it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at Christmas when its mighty Founder was a child himself
Stop
There was first a game at buff
Of course there was
And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots
My opinion is that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge's and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it
The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature
Knocking down the tumbling over the chairs bumping against the piano smothering himself among the curtains wherever she went there went he
He always knew where the plump sister was
He wouldn't catch anybody else
If you had fallen up against him as some of them on purpose he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you which would have been an affront to your understanding and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister
She often cried out that it wasn't and it really was not
But when at last he caught when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him he got her into a corner whence there was no then his conduct was the most execrable
For his pretending not to know his pretending that it was necessary to touch her and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger and a certain chain about her was vile monstrous
No doubt she told him her opinion of it when another being in office they were so very confidential together behind the curtains
Scrooge's niece was not one of the buff party but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her
But she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet
Likewise at the game of How When and Where she was very great and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too as Topper could have told you
There might have been twenty people there young and old but they all played and so did for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that his voice made no sound in their ears he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed quite right for the sharpest needle best Whitechapel warranted not to cut in the eye was not sharper than blunt as he took it in his head to be
The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed
But this the Spirit said could not be done
Here is a new said Scrooge
One half hour Spirit only one
It was a Game called Yes and No where Scrooge's nephew had to think of something and the rest must find out he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was
The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal a live animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal an animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in London and walked about the streets and wasn't made a show of and wasn't led by anybody and didn't live in a menagerie and was never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear
At every fresh question that was put to him this nephew burst into a fresh roar of and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp
At last the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out I have found it out
I know what it is Fred
I know what it is
What is it
cried Fred
It's your Uncle
Which it certainly was
Admiration was the universal sentiment though some objected that the reply to Is it a bear
ought to have been inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr
Scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way
He has given us plenty of merriment I am said Fred and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health
Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the and I say Uncle Scrooge
Well
Uncle Scrooge
they cried
A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man whatever he is
said Scrooge's nephew
He wouldn't take it from me but may he have it nevertheless
Uncle Scrooge
Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech if the Ghost had given him time
But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels
Much they saw and far they went and many homes they visited but always with a happy end
The Spirit stood beside sick beds and they were on foreign lands and they were close at by struggling men and they were patient in their greater by poverty and it was rich
In almshouse hospital and jail in misery's every refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the Spirit out he left his blessing and taught Scrooge his precepts
It was a long night if it were only a but Scrooge had his doubts of this because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together
It was strange too that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form the Ghost grew older clearly older
Scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of it until they left a children's Twelfth Night party when looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place he noticed that its hair was grey
Are spirits lives so short
asked Scrooge
My life upon this globe is very replied the Ghost
It ends
cried Scrooge
at midnight
Hark
The time is drawing near
The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment
Forgive me if I am not justified in what I said Scrooge looking intently at the Spirit's robe but I see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts
Is it a foot or a claw
It might be a claw for the flesh there is upon was the Spirit's sorrowful reply
Look here
From the foldings of its robe it brought two wretched abject frightful hideous miserable
They knelt down at its feet and clung upon the outside of its garment
Oh Man
look here
Look look down here
exclaimed the Ghost
They were a boy and girl
Yellow meagre ragged scowling but prostrate too in their humility
Where graceful youth should have filled their features out and touched them with its freshest tints a stale and shrivelled hand like that of age had pinched and twisted them and pulled them into shreds
Where angels might have sat enthroned devils lurked and glared out menacing
No change no degradation no perversion of humanity in any grade through all the mysteries of wonderful creation has monsters half so horrible and dread
Scrooge started back appalled
Having them shown to him in this way he tried to say they were fine children but the words choked themselves rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude
Spirit
are they yours
Scrooge could say no more
They are said the Spirit looking down upon them
And they cling to me appealing from their fathers
This boy is Ignorance
This girl is Want
Beware them both and all of their degree but most of all beware this boy for on his brow I see that written which is Doom unless the writing be erased
Deny it
cried the Spirit stretching out its hand towards the city
Slander those who tell it ye
Admit it for your factious purposes and make it worse
And bide the end
Have they no refuge or resource
cried Scrooge
Are there no prisons
said the Spirit turning on him for the last time with his own words
Are there no workhouses
The bell struck twelve
Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost and saw it not
As the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley and lifting up his eyes beheld a solemn Phantom draped and hooded coming like a mist along the ground towards him
STAVE IV THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS THE Phantom slowly gravely silently approached
When it came near him Scrooge bent down upon his for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery
It was shrouded in a deep black garment which concealed its head its face its form and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand
But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded
He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread
He knew no more for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved
I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come
said Scrooge
The Spirit answered not but pointed onward with its hand
You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen in the time before Scrooge pursued
Is that so Spirit
The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds as if the Spirit had inclined its head
That was the only answer he received
Although well used to ghostly company by this time Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it
The Spirit paused a moment as observing his condition and giving him time to recover
But Scrooge was all the worse for this
It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror to know that behind the dusky shroud there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him while he though he stretched his own to the utmost could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black
Ghost of the Future
he exclaimed I fear you more than any spectre I have seen
But as I know your purpose is to do me good and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was I am prepared to bear you company and do it with a thankful heart
Will you not speak to me
It gave him no reply
The hand was pointed straight before them
Lead on
said Scrooge
Lead on
The night is waning fast and it is precious time to me I know
Lead on Spirit
The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him
Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress which bore him up he thought and carried him along
They scarcely seemed to enter the for the city rather seemed to spring up about them and encompass them of its own act
But there they were in the heart of on Change amongst the who hurried up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in groups and looked at their watches and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold and so forth as Scrooge had seen them often
The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men
Observing that the hand was pointed to them Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk
said a great fat man with a monstrous chin I don't know much about it either way
I only know he's dead
When did he die
inquired another
Last night I believe
Why what was the matter with him
asked a third taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large
I thought he'd never die
God said the first with a yawn
What has he done with his money
asked a gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose that shook like the gills of a
I haven't said the man with the large chin yawning again
Left it to his company perhaps
He hasn't left it to me
That's all I know
This pleasantry was received with a general laugh
It's likely to be a very cheap said the same for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go to it
Suppose we make up a party and volunteer
I don't mind going if a lunch is observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose
But I must be fed if I make one
Another laugh
Well I am the most disinterested among you after said the first speaker for I never wear black gloves and I never eat lunch
But I'll offer to go if anybody else will
When I come to think of it I'm not at all sure that I wasn't his most particular for we used to stop and speak whenever we met
Bye bye
Speakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with other groups
Scrooge knew the men and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation
The Phantom glided on into a street
Its finger pointed to two persons meeting
Scrooge listened again thinking that the explanation might lie here
He knew these men also perfectly
They were men of business very wealthy and of great importance
He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem in a business point of view that strictly in a business point of view
How are you
said one
How are you
returned the other
Well
said the first
Old Scratch has got his own at last hey
So I am returned the second
Cold isn't it
Seasonable for Christmas time
You're not a skater I suppose
No
No
Something else to think of
Good morning
Not another word
That was their meeting their conversation and their parting
Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose he set himself to consider what it was likely to be
They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob his old partner for that was Past and this Ghost's province was the Future
Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them
But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement he resolved to treasure up every word he heard and everything he and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared
For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed and would render the solution of these riddles easy
He looked about in that very place for his own but another man stood in his accustomed corner and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch
It gave him little surprise for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life and thought and hoped he saw his resolutions carried out in this
Quiet and dark beside him stood the Phantom with its outstretched hand
When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest he fancied from the turn of the hand and its situation in reference to himself that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly
It made him shudder and feel very cold
They left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where Scrooge had never penetrated before although he recognised its situation and its bad repute
The ways were foul and the shops and houses the people drunken slipshod ugly
Alleys and archways like so many cesspools disgorged their offences of smell and dirt and life upon the straggling and the whole quarter reeked with crime with filth and misery
Far in this den of infamous resort there was a beetling shop below a roof where iron old rags bottles bones and greasy offal were bought
Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys nails chains hinges files scales weights and refuse iron of all kinds
Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags masses of corrupted fat and sepulchres of bones
Sitting in among the wares he dealt in by a charcoal stove made of old bricks was a rascal nearly seventy years of who had screened himself from the cold air without by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement
Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop
But she had scarcely entered when another woman similarly laden came in and she was closely followed by a man in faded black who was no less startled by the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other
After a short period of blank astonishment in which the old man with the pipe had joined them they all three burst into a laugh
Let the charwoman alone to be the first
cried she who had entered first
Let the laundress alone to be the and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third
Look here old Joe here's a chance
If we haven't all three met here without meaning it
You couldn't have met in a better said old Joe removing his pipe from his mouth
Come into the parlour
You were made free of it long ago you and the other two an't strangers
Stop till I shut the door of the shop
Ah
How it skreeks
There an't such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges I and I'm sure there's no such old bones here as mine
Ha ha
We're all suitable to our calling we're well matched
Come into the parlour
Come into the parlour
The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags
The old man raked the fire together with an old and having trimmed his smoky lamp for it was with the stem of his pipe put it in his mouth again
While he did this the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor and sat down in a flaunting manner on a crossing her elbows on her knees and looking with a bold defiance at the other two
What odds then
What odds Mrs
Dilber
said the woman
Every person has a right to take care of themselves
He always did
That's true indeed
said the laundress
No man more so
Why then don't stand staring as if you was afraid who's the wiser
We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats I suppose
No indeed
said Mrs
Dilber and the man together
We should hope not
Very well then
cried the woman
That's enough
Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these
Not a dead man I suppose
No said Mrs
Dilber laughing
If he wanted to keep em after he was dead a wicked old pursued the woman why wasn't he natural in his lifetime
If he had been he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death instead of lying gasping out his last there alone by himself
It's the truest word that ever was said Mrs
Dilber
It's a judgment on him
I wish it was a little heavier replied the and it should have been you may depend upon it if I could have laid my hands on anything else
Open that bundle old Joe and let me know the value of it
Speak out plain
I'm not afraid to be the first nor afraid for them to see it
We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we met here I believe
It's no sin
Open the bundle Joe
But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of and the man in faded black mounting the breach first produced his plunder
It was not extensive
A seal or two a a pair of and a brooch of no great value were all
They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each upon the wall and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come
That's your said Joe and I wouldn't give another sixpence if I was to be boiled for not doing it
Who's next
Mrs
Dilber was next
Sheets and towels a little wearing apparel two silver teaspoons a pair of and a few boots
Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner
I always give too much to ladies
It's a weakness of mine and that's the way I ruin said old Joe
That's your account
If you asked me for another penny and made it an open question I'd repent of being so liberal and knock off
And now undo my bundle said the first woman
Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it and having unfastened a great many knots dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff
What do you call this
said Joe
Ah
returned the woman laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms
You don't mean to say you took em down rings and all with him lying there
said Joe
Yes I replied the woman
Why not
You were born to make your said Joe and you'll certainly do it
I certainly shan't hold my hand when I can get anything in it by reaching it out for the sake of such a man as He was I promise you returned the woman coolly
Don't drop that oil upon the blankets now
His blankets
asked Joe
Whose else's do you think
replied the woman
He isn't likely to take cold without em I dare say
I hope he didn't die of anything catching
Eh
said old Joe stopping in his work and looking up
Don't you be afraid of returned the woman
I an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for such things if he did
Ah
you may look through that shirt till your eyes but you won't find a hole in it nor a threadbare place
It's the best he had and a fine one too
They'd have wasted it if it hadn't been for me
What do you call wasting of it
asked old Joe
Putting it on him to be buried in to be replied the woman with a laugh
Somebody was fool enough to do it but I took it off again
If calico an't good enough for such a purpose it isn't good enough for anything
It's quite as becoming to the body
He can't look uglier than he did in that one
Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror
As they sat grouped about their spoil in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp he viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been greater though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse itself
Ha ha
laughed the same woman when old Joe producing a flannel bag with money in it told out their several gains upon the ground
This is the end of it you see
He frightened every one away from him when he was alive to profit us when he was dead
Ha ha ha
Spirit
said Scrooge shuddering from head to foot
I see I see
The case of this unhappy man might be my own
My life tends that way now
Merciful Heaven what is this
He recoiled in terror for the scene had changed and now he almost touched a bed a bare uncurtained bed on which beneath a ragged sheet there lay a something covered up which though it was dumb announced itself in awful language
The room was very dark too dark to be observed with any accuracy though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse anxious to know what kind of room it was
A pale light rising in the outer air fell straight upon the and on it plundered and bereft unwatched unwept uncared for was the body of this man
Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom
Its steady hand was pointed to the head
The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part would have disclosed the face
He thought of it felt how easy it would be to do and longed to do but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side
Oh cold cold rigid dreadful Death set up thine altar here and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command for this is thy dominion
But of the loved revered and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes or make one feature odious
It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when it is not that the heart and pulse are but that the hand WAS open generous and the heart brave warm and and the pulse a man's
Strike Shadow strike
And see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world with life immortal
No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed
He thought if this man could be raised up now what would be his foremost thoughts
Avarice griping cares
They have brought him to a rich end truly
He lay in the dark empty house with not a man a woman or a child to say that he was kind to me in this or that and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him
A cat was tearing at the door and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the
What they wanted in the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed Scrooge did not dare to think
Spirit
he said this is a fearful place
In leaving it I shall not leave its lesson trust me
Let us go
Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head
I understand Scrooge returned and I would do it if I could
But I have not the power Spirit
I have not the power
Again it seemed to look upon him
If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this man's said Scrooge quite agonised show that person to me Spirit I beseech you
The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment like a and withdrawing it revealed a room by daylight where a mother and her children were
She was expecting some one and with anxious for she walked up and down the started at every looked out from the glanced at the tried but in vain to work with her and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play
At length the knock was heard
She hurried to the door and met her a man whose face was careworn and depressed though he was young
There was a remarkable expression in it a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to repress
He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the and when she asked him faintly what news which was not until after a long he appeared embarrassed how to answer
Is it good
she said or bad
help him
he answered
We are quite ruined
No
There is hope yet Caroline
If he she said amazed there is
Nothing is past hope if such a miracle has happened
He is past said her husband
He is dead
She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke but she was thankful in her soul to hear it and she said so with clasped hands
She prayed forgiveness the next moment and was but the first was the emotion of her heart
What the woman whom I told you of last night said to me when I tried to see him and obtain a week's and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid turns out to have been quite true
He was not only very ill but dying then
To whom will our debt be transferred
I don't know
But before that time we shall be ready with the and even though we were not it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor
We may sleep with light hearts Caroline
Yes
Soften it as they would their hearts were lighter
The children's faces hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood were and it was a happier house for this man's death
The only emotion that the Ghost could show him caused by the event was one of pleasure
Let me see some tenderness connected with a said or that dark chamber Spirit which we left just now will be for ever present to me
The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his and as they went along Scrooge looked here and there to find himself but nowhere was he to be seen
They entered poor Bob Cratchit's the dwelling he had visited and found the mother and the children seated round the fire
Quiet
Very quiet
The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner and sat looking up at Peter who had a book before him
The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing
But surely they were very quiet
'And He took a child and set him in the midst of them
Where had Scrooge heard those words
He had not dreamed them
The boy must have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold
Why did he not go on
The mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her face
The colour hurts my she said
The colour
Ah poor Tiny Tim
They're better now said Cratchit's wife
It makes them weak by and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes home for the world
It must be near his time
Past it Peter answered shutting up his book
But I think he has walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings mother
They were very quiet again
At last she said and in a steady cheerful voice that only faltered once I have known him walk have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed
And so have cried Peter
Often
And so have exclaimed another
So had all
But he was very light to she resumed intent upon her work and his father loved him so that it was no trouble no trouble
And there is your father at the door
She hurried out to meet and little Bob in his comforter had need of it poor in
His tea was ready for him on the hob and they all tried who should help him to it most
Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against his face as if they said Don't mind it father
Don't be grieved
Bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family
He looked at the work upon the table and praised the industry and speed of Mrs
Cratchit and the girls
They would be done long before Sunday he said
Sunday
You went then Robert
said his wife
Yes my returned Bob
I wish you could have gone
It would have done you good to see how green a place it is
But you'll see it often
I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday
My little little child
cried Bob
My little child
He broke down all at once
He couldn't help it
If he could have helped it he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were
He left the room and went into the room above which was lighted cheerfully and hung with Christmas
There was a chair set close beside the child and there were signs of some one having been there lately
Poor Bob sat down in it and when he had thought a little and composed himself he kissed the little face
He was reconciled to what had happened and went down again quite happy
They drew about the fire and the girls and mother working still
Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr
Scrooge's nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked a a little down you said Bob inquired what had happened to distress him
On said Bob for he is the gentleman you ever heard I told him
I am heartily sorry for it Mr
he said and heartily sorry for your good wife
By the bye how he ever knew that I don't know
Knew what my dear
Why that you were a good replied Bob
Everybody knows that
said Peter
Very well observed my boy
cried Bob
I hope they do
Heartily he said for your good wife
If I can be of service to you in any he said giving me his card that's where I live
Pray come to me
Now it cried Bob for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us so much as for his kind way that this was quite delightful
It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim and felt with us
I'm sure he's a good soul
said Mrs
Cratchit
You would be surer of it my returned Bob if you saw and spoke to him
I shouldn't be at all mark what I say
he got Peter a better situation
Only hear that said Mrs
Cratchit
And cried one of the girls Peter will be keeping company with some one and setting up for himself
Get along with you
retorted Peter grinning
It's just as likely as said Bob one of these though there's plenty of time for that my dear
But however and whenever we part from one another I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny this first parting that there was among us
Never father
cried they all
And I said Bob I know my dears that when we recollect how patient and how mild he although he was a little little we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it
No never father
they all cried again
I am very said little Bob I am very happy
Mrs
Cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young Cratchits kissed him and Peter and himself shook hands
Spirit of Tiny Tim thy childish essence was from God
said Scrooge something informs me that our parting moment is at hand
I know it but I know not how
Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead
The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him as at a different time he thought indeed there seemed no order in these latter visions save that they were in the the resorts of business men but showed him not himself
Indeed the Spirit did not stay for anything but went straight on as to the end just now desired until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment
This said Scrooge through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation is and has been for a length of time
I see the house
Let me behold what I shall be in days to come
The Spirit the hand was pointed elsewhere
The house is Scrooge exclaimed
Why do you point away
The inexorable finger underwent no change
Scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in
It was an office still but not his
The furniture was not the same and the figure in the chair was not himself
The Phantom pointed as before
He joined it once again and wondering why and whither he had gone accompanied it until they reached an iron gate
He paused to look round before entering
A churchyard
Here the wretched man whose name he had now to learn lay underneath the ground
It was a worthy place
Walled in by overrun by grass and weeds the growth of vegetation's death not choked up with too much fat with repleted appetite
A worthy place
The Spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to One
He advanced towards it trembling
The Phantom was exactly as it had been but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape
Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you said Scrooge answer me one question
Are these the shadows of the things that Will be or are they shadows of things that May be only
Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood
Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in they must said Scrooge
But if the courses be departed from the ends will change
Say it is thus with what you show me
The Spirit was immovable as ever
Scrooge crept towards it trembling as he and following the finger read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name EBENEZER SCROOGE
Am I that man who lay upon the bed
he cried upon his knees
The finger pointed from the grave to him and back again
No Spirit
Oh no no
The finger still was there
Spirit
he cried tight clutching at its robe hear me
I am not the man I was
I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse
Why show me this if I am past all hope
For the first time the hand appeared to shake
Good he pursued as down upon the ground he fell before it Your nature intercedes for me and pities me
Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life
The kind hand trembled
I will honour Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year
I will live in the Past the Present and the Future
The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me
I will not shut out the lessons that they teach
Oh tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone
In his agony he caught the spectral hand
It sought to free itself but he was strong in his entreaty and detained it
The Spirit stronger yet repulsed him
Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress
It shrunk collapsed and dwindled down into a bedpost
STAVE V THE END OF IT YES
and the bedpost was his own
The bed was his own the room was his own
Best and happiest of all the Time before him was his own to make amends in
I will live in the Past the Present and the Future
Scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed
The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me
Oh Jacob Marley
Heaven and the Christmas Time be praised for this
I say it on my knees old on my knees
He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call
He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit and his face was wet with tears
They are not torn cried Scrooge folding one of his in his arms they are not torn down rings and all
They are am shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled
They will be
I know they will
His hands were busy with his garments all this turning them inside out putting them on upside down tearing them mislaying them making them parties to every kind of extravagance
I don't know what to do
cried Scrooge laughing and crying in the same and making a perfect of himself with his stockings
I am as light as a feather I am as happy as an angel I am as merry as a schoolboy
I am as giddy as a drunken man
A merry Christmas to everybody
A happy New Year to all the world
Hallo here
Whoop
Hallo
He had frisked into the and was now standing there perfectly winded
There's the saucepan that the gruel was in
cried Scrooge starting off again and going round the fireplace
There's the door by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered
There's the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present sat
There's the window where I saw the wandering Spirits
It's all right it's all true it all happened
Ha ha ha
Really for a man who had been out of practice for so many years it was a splendid laugh a most illustrious laugh
The father of a long long line of brilliant laughs
I don't know what day of the month it is
said Scrooge
I don't know how long I've been among the Spirits
I don't know anything
I'm quite a baby
Never mind
I don't care
I'd rather be a baby
Hallo
Whoop
Hallo here
He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard
Clash clang ding dong bell
Bell dong hammer clang clash
Oh glorious glorious
Running to the window he opened it and put out his head
No fog no clear bright jovial stirring cold piping for the blood to dance Golden Heavenly sweet fresh merry bells
Oh glorious
Glorious
What's
cried Scrooge calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes who perhaps had loitered in to look about him
EH
returned the boy with all his might of wonder
What's my fine fellow
said Scrooge
replied the boy
Why CHRISTMAS DAY
It's Christmas Day
said Scrooge to himself
I haven't missed it
The Spirits have done it all in one night
They can do anything they like
Of course they can
Of course they can
Hallo my fine fellow
Hallo
returned the boy
Do you know the Poulterer's in the next street but one at the corner
Scrooge inquired
I should hope I replied the lad
An intelligent boy
said Scrooge
A remarkable boy
Do you know whether they've sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there
the little prize Turkey the big one
What the one as big as me
returned the boy
What a delightful boy
said Scrooge
It's a pleasure to talk to him
Yes my buck
It's hanging there replied the boy
Is it
said Scrooge
Go and buy it
exclaimed the boy
No said Scrooge I am in earnest
Go and buy it and tell em to bring it here that I may give them the direction where to take it
Come back with the man and I'll give you a shilling
Come back with him in less than five minutes and I'll give you
The boy was off like a shot
He must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast
I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's
whispered Scrooge rubbing his hands and splitting with a laugh
He sha'n't know who sends it
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim
Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's will be
The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one but write it he did somehow and went to open the street door ready for the coming of the poulterer's man
As he stood there waiting his arrival the knocker caught his eye
I shall love it as long as I live
cried Scrooge patting it with his hand
I scarcely ever looked at it before
What an honest expression it has in its face
It's a wonderful knocker
the Turkey
Hallo
Whoop
How are you
Merry Christmas
It was a Turkey
He never could have stood upon his legs that bird
He would have snapped em short off in a minute like sticks of
Why it's impossible to carry that to Camden said Scrooge
You must have a cab
The chuckle with which he said this and the chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and chuckled till he cried
Shaving was not an easy task for his hand continued to shake very and shaving requires attention even when you don't dance while you are at it
But if he had cut the end of his nose off he would have put a piece of over it and been quite satisfied
He dressed himself all in his and at last got out into the streets
The people were by this time pouring forth as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas and walking with his hands behind him Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile
He looked so irresistibly pleasant in a word that three or four fellows said Good morning sir
A merry Christmas to you
And Scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard those were the blithest in his ears
He had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his the day before and said Scrooge and Marley's I believe
It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it
My dear said Scrooge quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman by both his hands
How do you do
I hope you succeeded yesterday
It was very kind of you
A merry Christmas to you sir
Mr
Scrooge
said Scrooge
That is my name and I fear it may not be pleasant to you
Allow me to ask your pardon
And will you have the Scrooge whispered in his ear
Lord bless me
cried the gentleman as if his breath were taken away
My dear Mr
Scrooge are you serious
If you said Scrooge
Not a farthing less
A great many are included in it I assure you
Will you do me that favour
My dear said the other shaking hands with him
I don't know what to say to such Don't say anything retorted Scrooge
Come and see me
Will you come and see me
I will
cried the old gentleman
And it was clear he meant to do it
said Scrooge
I am much obliged to you
I thank you fifty times
Bless you
He went to church and walked about the streets and watched the people hurrying to and fro and patted children on the head and questioned beggars and looked down into the kitchens of houses and up to the windows and found that everything could yield him pleasure
He had never dreamed that any give him so much happiness
In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's house
He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock
But he made a dash and did it Is your master at home my dear
said Scrooge to the girl
Nice girl
Very
Yes sir
Where is he my love
said Scrooge
He's in the sir along with mistress
I'll show you if you please
Thank'ee
He knows said Scrooge with his hand already on the lock
I'll go in here my dear
He turned it gently and sidled his face in round the door
They were looking at the table which was spread out in great for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points and like to see that everything is right
Fred
said Scrooge
Dear heart alive how his niece by marriage started
Scrooge had forgotten for the moment about her sitting in the corner with the footstool or he wouldn't have done it on any account
Why bless my soul
cried Fred who's that
It's I
Your uncle Scrooge
I have come to dinner
Will you let me in Fred
Let him in
It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off
He was at home in five minutes
Nothing could be heartier
His niece looked just the same
So did Topper when he came
So did the plump sister when she came
So did every one when they came
Wonderful party wonderful games wonderful unanimity happiness
But he was early at the office next morning
Oh he was early there
If he could only be there first and catch Bob Cratchit coming late
That was the thing he had set his heart upon
And he did yes he did
The clock struck nine
No Bob
A quarter past
No Bob
He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time
Scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him come into the Tank
His hat was off before he opened the his comforter too
He was on his stool in a driving away with his pen as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock
Hallo
growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it
What do you mean by coming here at this time of day
I am very sorry said Bob
I am behind my time
You are
repeated Scrooge
Yes
I think you are
Step this way sir if you please
It's only once a year pleaded Bob appearing from the Tank
It shall not be repeated
I was making rather merry yesterday sir
Now I'll tell you what my said Scrooge I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer
And he continued leaping from his stool and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank and therefore I am about to raise your salary
Bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler
He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it holding him and calling to the people in the court for help and a
A merry Christmas Bob
said Scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken as he clapped him on the back
A merrier Christmas Bob my good fellow than I have given you for many a year
I'll raise your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling family and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop Bob
Make up the fires and buy another before you dot another i Bob Cratchit
Scrooge was better than his word
He did it all and infinitely and to Tiny Tim who did NOT die he was a second father
He became as good a friend as good a master and as good a man as the good old city knew or any other good old city town or borough in the good old world
Some people laughed to see the alteration in him but he let them laugh and little heeded for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe for good at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less attractive forms
His own heart laughed and that was quite enough for him
He had no further intercourse with Spirits but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle ever and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well if any man alive possessed the knowledge
May that be truly said of us and all of us
And so as Tiny Tim observed God bless Us Every One
