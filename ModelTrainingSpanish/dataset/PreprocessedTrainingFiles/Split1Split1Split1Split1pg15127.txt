PREFACE
With the best intention of justifying Messrs
confidence in
entrusting me with the compilation of a Spanish Grammar to form part of
the series of Commercial I set to work to produce a book
which while avoiding pedantry and the agglomeration of superfluous and
intricate rules which puzzle the student should equally avoid falling
into the extreme of coarseness which debases the subject under study or
the scrappiness resulting in gaps that perplex and discourage him
I
have tried to be brief and clear in the rules given
The vocabulary has been chosen carefully avoiding the artificiality of
too much commercial technology but keeping constantly in view the
object of the Series viz
to produce grammars specially suitable for
students preparing for a commercial career
Whether I have succeeded in my efforts it is for the public to judge
I
can only say that after more than years teaching of
Spanish in all its stages privately at the Manchester University and
in the large classes of our public Institutions I have tried my best to
give the fruits of my experience to any interested young people who may
be eager to learn a language beautiful noble and most useful
I do not claim to have reached perfection
I only trust the book such
as it presents itself will be of real help to the student
