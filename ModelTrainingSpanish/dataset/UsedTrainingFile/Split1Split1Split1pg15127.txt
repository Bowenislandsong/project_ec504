PITMAN'S COMMERCIAL SPANISH GRAMMAR..                             BY..                       C. A. TOLEDANO..                            1917.....                          PREFACE..With the best intention of justifying Messrs. PITMAN'S confidence in.entrusting me with the compilation of a Spanish Grammar to form part of.the series of "Commercial Grammars," I set to work to produce a book.which, while avoiding pedantry and the agglomeration of superfluous and.intricate rules which puzzle the student, should equally avoid falling.into the extreme of coarseness which debases the subject under study, or.the scrappiness resulting in gaps that perplex and discourage him. I.have tried to be brief and clear in the rules given...The vocabulary has been chosen carefully, avoiding the artificiality of.too much commercial technology, but keeping constantly in view the.object of the Series, viz., to produce grammars specially suitable for.students preparing for a commercial career...Whether I have succeeded in my efforts it is for the public to judge. I.can only say that, after more than twenty-five years' teaching of.Spanish in all its stages, privately, at the Manchester University and.in the large classes of our public Institutions, I have tried my best to.give the fruits of my experience to any interested young people who may.be eager to learn a language beautiful, noble, and most useful...I do not claim to have reached perfection. I only trust the book, such.as it presents itself, will be of real help to the student...C.A. TOLEDANO...MANCHESTER, 1911.......                      COMMERCIAL SPANISH GRAMMAR.....
